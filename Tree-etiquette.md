- Only merge something if brave-browser jenkins CI status passes for the pipeline steps. If you don't know how to do this, check with @mihaiplesa for training.
- If you see something that's broken, or tests failing, instantly revert it. Do not wait to talk to the person that broke it, especially if they are not alone.  Re-open the issue that broke it.
- If you accidentally break the build, apologize and pay it forward.
- Check #brave-core Slack and only merge things if the channel topic indicates the branch you're landing to is open.
