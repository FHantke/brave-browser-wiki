## Upcoming Releases & Milestones

One of the best ways to see which features are coming down the pipeline and what Brave is currently working on is taking a look through the different [milestones](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/milestones). Each milestone has a set release date that can be found via the [Brave Release Schedule](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Brave-Release-Schedule).

* [1.7.x - Beta](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/milestone/84?closed=1) - Scheduled to be released on `April 7, 2020` and can be downloaded [here](http://brave.com/download-beta).
* [1.8.x - Nightly](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/milestone/92?closed=1) - Scheduled to be released on `April 28, 2020` and can be downloaded [here](http://brave.com/download-nightly).

## Upcoming Features

**`Disclaimer`** - the following timelines are approximations and are not set in stone. There's a lot of thought and work that goes into developing something complex like Brave. Sometimes schedules slip, sometimes certain feature are de-prioritized and others are prioritized. Given the disclaimer, this list should be pretty accurate in terms of when we expect certain features to be released.

This list assumes you're on the `Release` channel. Features land on the `Nightly` channel first and make their way through the train model as described via [Brave Release Schedule](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Brave-Release-Schedule).
