# Blocking notification servers

## 1. Blocking 3rd-party content.

Handling any 3rd-party servers on a website is a privacy and security concern. Based on blocking of other 3rd-party content in both Disconnect List and Easylist/Easyprivcy Lists, notifications servers should be treated no differently to other trackers. Notification servers could be used to potentially load malicious JavaScript without the end user being aware of it.

## 2. Annoyance factor.

Notification reminders can disrupt the user with notification spam elements. The end user visits the web page for the content of the site and not for the notification spam.
