If you navigate to brave://settings/socialBlocking, you will see an option to enable Allow Google Login in extensions and third party.

When this option is enabled:

1. It adds an exception for accounts.google.com so sites using `Login with Google` can work correctly.
2. It enables chrome.identity for extensions so extensions like Google Keep and Google Calendar can use an OAuth token from google to use these services in extensions.
