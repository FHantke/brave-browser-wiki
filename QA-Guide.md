How to test:
- Official builds
- Release builds done manually
- Debug builds, but for assertions make sure to take Debug only things with a `debug` label.'

Triage:
- Things are triaged into milestones, and assigned an owner by bbondy for now and by a triage meeting eventually.  There is a project that shows per user views of tasks.
