Brave Wallet was created as part of the Brave browser in order to bring cryptocurrency and web 3 access to Brave's users.

Users can access the Brave Wallet by navigating to brave://wallet or from the wallet icon at the top of the browser.

The Brave wallet will be home to a user's local cryptocurrency wallet, Brave Rewards wallet, credit cards, and other exchanges that we support oauthâ€™ing to such as Uphold, Binance, and Gemini or our own Creators portal (so that creators can manage their earnings balance through Brave Wallet)

## Ethereum provider global object

The `window.ethereum` object is provided by Brave's wallet to web pages. You can read about it here: https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Ethereum-Provider-API

## Settings

Brave Wallet settings can be accessed from: brave://settings/wallet

#### Default wallet

The default wallet setting can be set to one of the following values:

- `Brave Wallet (Prefer extensions)`: This is the default setting. With this setting, `window.ethereum` is exposed by Brave Wallet; however, extensions such as MetaMask are still allowed to overwrite `window.ethereum`.
- `Brave Wallet`: With this setting `window.ethereum` is exposed by Brave Wallet and extensions do not have access to overwrite `window.ethereum`.
- `Crypto Wallets (Deprecated)`: This setting only shows up for existing users that have used Crypto Wallets in the past.  Crypto Wallets was Brave's old cryptocurrency wallet and it was a MetaMask fork. If this setting is selected, navigating to brave://wallet will load Crypto Wallets instead of Brave Wallet. New users can access this setting only if they have brave://flags/#ethereum_remote-client_new-installs set to true manually.
- `None`: With this setting users can still navigate to brave://wallet, however no `window.ethereum` object is exposed.

### Networks

EVM compatible networks can be added here: brave://settings/wallet/networks
You can visit https://chainlist.org/ for a list of supported chains.

### Reset Wallet

This allows you to reset all of your wallet state back to the original default. Ensure you have a backup of your seed phrase and imported keys before using this option.

### Ethereum permission management

Permissions in Brave Wallet are managed by content settings. They can be modified for which sites have access to your addresses here:
brave://settings/content/ethereum

If a Dapp has previously requested access to a page and was given permission, then it will show up in this page as well.


## HD Wallet

Bitcoin and Ethereum generate addresses in different ways, but they share the same key derivation implementations as BIP-32 compatible wallets. 

The Brave wallet implements BIP-32 (HD wallet), BIP-39 (Mnemonic keywords), BIP-43 (Multipurpose HD wallet structure), and BIP-44 (Multicurrency and multi account wallets).
