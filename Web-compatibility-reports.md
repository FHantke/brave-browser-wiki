Web Compatibility Reports are voluntary user-submitted reports that Brave uses to enhance web compatibility with the Brave Shields feature. Because Brave Shields introduces a lot of cutting-edge Web privacy interventions, this sometimes breaks websites which are not used to being unable to call out to third-parties, fingerprint users, show cookie banners, or use privacy-harmful Web APIs.

User-submitted reports help Brave discover and fix these compatibility issues, promoting a better browsing experience for all Brave users.

## Data Collected

The following is a list of data that Brave may collect from user-submitted Web Compatibility Reports. It's important to note that all data submission is voluntary, and privacy is a primary concern. 

- **URL of the reported website:** The address of the site with issues. To maximize privacy, any query parameters and fragments are omitted.
- **Release channel:** This tells Brave which channel (Nightly/Beta/Release) of the browser the user was on.
- **App version:** This tells Brave what version of the Brave app (e.g. 1.67) the user was on.
- **The Shields enabled status:** Whether or not the user had Shields active.
- **Ad-block setting:** The configured level of the ad-blocking setting.
- **Fingerprint blocking setting:** The configured level of fingerprint blocking.
- **Enabled ad-block lists:** This identifies which ad-block lists the user has activated. To maximize privacy, custom filter lists are NOT included.
- **User-configured languages:** The languages that a user had configured in their browser settings.
- **Language farbling status:** Whether or not the "language farbling" privacy-enhancing feature was enabled.
- **Brave VPN connection status (if any):** If the user was connected to the Brave VPN at the time, if the user is a subscriber to Brave VPN.

In addition to this, the user may choose to provide the following optional details:

- **Problem details:** A detailed description of the compatibility issue as the user experienced it.
- **Contact details:** This can be useful if additional follow-up or clarification is necessary.
- **Screenshot of the viewport:** It gives visual context to the problem faced by the user and can provide valuable clues for resolution.

User reports are deleted from Brave's servers after 30 days.
