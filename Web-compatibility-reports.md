Web Compatibility Reports are voluntary user-submitted reports that Brave uses to enhance web compatibility with the Brave Shields feature. These reports are essential tools in continuously improving Brave. User-submitted reports help discover and fix compatibility issues with various websites when the Brave Shields feature is turned on, promoting a better browsing experience for all Brave users.

## Data Collected

The following is a list of data that Brave collects from user-submitted Web Compatibility Reports. It's important to note that all data submission is voluntary, and privacy is a primary concern. 

- **URL of the reported website:** The web address of the site with issues is collected but any query parameters and fragment are omitted for privacy.
- **Release channel:** This tells Brave which version of our browser the user is on when they encounter the issue.
- **The Shields enabled status:** Whether or not the user had Shields active at the time of encountering the issue.
- **Ad-block setting:** The configured level of the ad-blocking setting at the time of the report.
- **Fingerprint blocking setting:** The configured level of the fingerprint blocking at the time of the report.
- **Enabled ad-block lists:** This identifies which ad-block lists the user has activated.
- **User-configured languages:** The languages that a user had configured in their browser settings near the time of the issue.
- **Language farbling status:** Whether or not the "language farbling" privacy-enhancing feature was enabled at the time of the report.
- **Brave VPN connection status (if any):** If the user was connected to the Brave VPN at the time, if the user is a subscriber to Brave VPN.

In addition to this, the user may choose to provide the following optional details:

- **Problem details:** A detailed description of the compatibility issue as the user experienced it.
- **Contact details:** This can be useful if additional follow-up or clarification is necessary.
- **Screenshot of the viewport:** It gives visual context to the problem faced by the user and can provide valuable clues for resolution.
