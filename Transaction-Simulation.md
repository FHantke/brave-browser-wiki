# How does it work?
Checks blocklists to see if the domain and/or contract the user is interacting with is dangerous or flagged by Blowfish’s risk engine.
Uses transaction analysis and machine learning to provide crucial information to the user before signing

# Why It’s Important to Brave Wallet
It will help users stay safe whilst transacting with DApps
Using Blowfish’s risk scoring and domain intelligence, we can give extra warnings to users before they sign a transaction
Much better UI for the majority of transactions as the ‘Safe Sign’ UI is only used with Brave Swaps and Matcha.xyz
